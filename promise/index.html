    <h1>To My Dear Onshi</h1>
    <p>As <span class="main">Promise Day</span> dawns upon us, 
        I promise, to be beside you for the rest of life... till death do us part.. nah in this life and the after life I will love you.. 
        Each day My love for you increases.. every day I fall for you harder.<br><br>
        Today, I want to make you a promise - a promise to stand by your side through thick and thin, to support you in your dreams and aspirations, and to cherish every moment we share together.
         <br><br>
        I promise to be your rock, your confidant, and your best friend.
        I promise to listen to you, to keep your secrets, to hold you in your happiness and sorrow.
        I promise to understand you, and to love you unconditionally.
        I promise to laugh with you in times of joy and hold you close in times of sorrow.
        I promise to respect you, to honor you, and to always be honest with you.
         <br><br>
        But above all, I promise to love you fiercely and passionately, now and for all eternity. 
        You are my light, my love, and my everything.
        Happy Promise Day, love. Here's to a lifetime of love, laughter, and endless promises fulfilled.</p>
